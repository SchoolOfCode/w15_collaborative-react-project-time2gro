# About Time2Gro

Time2Gro was created by Claudiu Manta, Natalie Pinnock and Ryan Brown to make growing vegetables easier for people. 

The website allows the user to either pick a vegetable from a long list of options or lets the user pick a vegetable to grow based on their experience level. 

The growing instructions are fetched from the Harvest Helper API so the user gets detailed instructions of how to grow their ideal vegetable. 

The website is built in React.
