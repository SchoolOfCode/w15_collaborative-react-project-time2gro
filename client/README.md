# About Time2Gro

Time2Gro is a website created to help people who are conscious of their food sources and would like to grow their own vergetables. The website aims to equip users with guidance and useful tips to simplify the process of growing their own vegetables.


## Main features
The App allows users to choose from a dropdown list of vegetables. They are then provided information such as the sun level, space and time needed to grow the particular vegetable.
There is also the option to allow the app to chose a vegetable on behalf of the user based on chosen difficulty level.
